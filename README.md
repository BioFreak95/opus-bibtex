# BibTeX Module for OPUS 4

IN DEVELOPMENT - For now this is an experiment in developing a OPUS 4 module outside of the main code base.

This module will eventually support exporting and importing documents in the BibTeX format.

While exporting documents in BibTeX is already working in OPUS 4, the code is not yet located in this module.

Importing BibTeX without user interaction is not really possible because BibTeX files come in many flavors often
with custom fields that are not part of any standard. Therefore it is necessary to allow the user to decide on 
custom mappings and interpretations of the fields in the specific file. We are currently things about ways to 
provide this functionality.
